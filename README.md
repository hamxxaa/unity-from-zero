## Purpose

This repository serves as a learning project to understand Unity's fundamental systems and game development patterns through hands-on implementation of a simple but complete game prototype.

## Projects

### Tower Defense Game (`towerd/`)

A basic tower defense game where players place turrets to defend a base against incoming enemy waves. Turrets automatically target and shoot enemies within range.

### Tank Arena ('tank-arena/')
Players control a tank in a procedurally generated cyber-grid arena. The goal is to survive against increasing waves of enemies using physics-based movement and shooting mechanics.
